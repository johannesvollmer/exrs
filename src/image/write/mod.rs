//! Write an exr image to a file.
//!
//! First, call `my_image.write()`. The resulting value can be customized, like this:
//! ```no_run
//!     use exr::prelude::*;
//! #   let my_image: FlatImage = unimplemented!();
//!
//!     my_image.write()
//!            .on_progress(|progress| println!("progress: {:.1}", progress*100.0))
//!            .to_file("image.exr").unwrap();
//! ```
