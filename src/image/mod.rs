//! Data structures that represent a complete exr image.
//! Contains generic structs that must be nested to obtain a complete image type.
//!
//!
//! For example, an rgba image containing multiple layers
//! can be represented using `Image<Layers<SpecificChannels<MyPixelStorage>>>`.
//! An image containing a single layer with arbitrary channels and no deep data
//! can be represented using `Image<Layer<AnyChannels<FlatSamples>>>`.
//!
//!
//! These and other predefined types are included in this module as
//! 1. `PixelImage`: A single layer, fixed set of arbitrary channels.
//! 1. `PixelLayersImage`: Multiple layers, fixed set of arbitrary channels.
//! 1. `RgbaImage`: A single layer, fixed set of channels: rgb, optional a.
//! 1. `RgbaLayersImage`: Multiple layers, fixed set of channels: rgb, optional a.
//! 1. `FlatImage`: Multiple layers, any channels, no deep data.
//! 1. `AnyImage`: All supported data (multiple layers, arbitrary channels, no deep data yet)
//!
//! You can also use your own types inside an image,
//! for example if you want to use a custom sample storage.
