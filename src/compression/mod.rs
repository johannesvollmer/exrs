    // A wavelet transform is applied to the pixel data, and the result is Huffman-

    // images that are typically processed at Industrial Light & Magic. Files are
    // compressed and decompressed at roughly the same speed. For photographic
    // images with film grain, the files are reduced to between 35 and 55 percent of their
    // uncompressed size.
    // PIZ compression works well for scan-line based files, and also for tiled files with
    // large tiles, but small tiles do not shrink much. (PIZ-compressed data start with a
    // relatively long header; if the input to the compressor is short, adding the header
    // tends to offset any size reduction of the input.)

    /// This compression method works well for depth
    /// buffers and similar images, where the possible range of values is very large, but
    /// where full 32-bit floating-point accuracy is not necessary. Rounding improves
    /// compression significantly by eliminating the pixels' 8 least significant bits, which
    /// tend to be very noisy, and therefore difficult to compress.
    /// This produces really small image files. Only supported for flat images, not for deep data.
    // After reducing 32-bit floating-point data to 24 bits by rounding (while leaving 16-bit
    // floating-point data unchanged), differences between horizontally adjacent pixels
    // are compressed with zlib, similar to ZIP. PXR24 compression preserves image
    // channels of type HALF and UINT exactly, but the relative error of FLOAT data
    // increases to about ???.

    ///
    /// Only supported for flat images, not for deep data.
    // lossy 4-by-4 pixel block compression,
    // flat fields are compressed more
    // Channels of type HALF are split into blocks of four by four pixels or 32 bytes. Each
    // block is then packed into 14 bytes, reducing the data to 44 percent of their
    // uncompressed size. When B44 compression is applied to RGB images in
    // combination with luminance/chroma encoding (see below), the size of the
    // compressed pixels is about 22 percent of the size of the original RGB data.
    // Channels of type UINT or FLOAT are not compressed.
    // Decoding is fast enough to allow real-time playback of B44-compressed OpenEXR
    // image sequences on commodity hardware.
    // The size of a B44-compressed file depends on the number of pixels in the image,
    // but not on the data in the pixels. All images with the same resolution and the same
    // set of channels have the same size. This can be advantageous for systems that
    // support real-time playback of image sequences; the predictable file size makes it
    // easier to allocate space on storage media efficiently.
