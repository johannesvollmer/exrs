# Examples

These are examples that demonstrate how to use `exrs`.

Some of these examples read image files
that can be generated by running a different example beforehand.
The examples are named such that running all examples alphabetically
will generate any image before it is used.

## Things you can find in the examples:
- Read image data into a custom data structure, without loosing any meta information: 
  `2_rgba_adjust_exposure`
- Access all pixel information in a file, fully dynamic:
  `6_extract_mip_map_pngs`
