# Examples

These are examples that demonstrate how to use `exrs`.

Some of these examples read image files
that can be generated by running a different example beforehand.
The examples are named such that running all examples alphabetically
will generate any image before it is used.

Only the cropping examples use images from the source repository's test folder.

## Things you can find in the examples:
- Read image data into a custom data structure, without loosing any meta information: 
  `2_rgba_adjust_exposure`
- Access all pixel information in a file, fully dynamic:
  `6_extract_mip_map_pngs`
